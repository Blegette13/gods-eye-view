# BDP Land Intelligence

This directory contains BDP Land Co-specific land intelligence capabilities layered on top of God's Eye View.

## Design rules

1. Keep BDP domain logic isolated from upstream geospatial/rendering code whenever possible.
2. Normalize county/CAD data before it reaches map or AI features.
3. Prefer authoritative APIs, GIS services, and bulk downloads over scraping.
4. Preserve source provenance and last-verified timestamps on every parcel record.
5. Treat legal, title, mineral, water, environmental, and entitlement outputs as decision support, not final professional determinations.

## Initial modules

- `config/` — Texas and BDP configuration.
- `parcels/` — parcel schema, normalization, rendering, and selection.
- `cad/` — county/CAD adapters and registry.
- `overlays/` — flood, wetlands, soil, energy, utilities, traffic, and environmental layers.
- `intelligence/` — acquisition scoring, red flags, best-use, and entitlement analysis.
- `ui/` — BDP property and acquisition interfaces.
